**# Estimated Upgrade Time: 1.5 Hours**

We attempt to make the shift from PHP 7.2 to PHP 8.1 as simple as possible. Some services have undergone significant changes as a result of third-party API providers. We have compiled a list of all services that have experienced noticeable changes, which you can find below. While it's not necessary to update all of these services, if you are using any of them, we recommend that you review the relevant section to expedite the development of your dream API.

{{< alert color="warning" title="Note" >}}
This article assumes that you are not using our automatic installers. However, if you have a different operating system or prefer not to handle the installation process manually, you can refer to the relevant guide [here](../installing-and-configuring-dreamfactory/#using-the-dreamfactory-installer). Please note that these steps are intended that you are using the [_Supported Ubuntu Release_](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
{{< /alert >}}

<h2>Switch to PHP 8.1</h2>
This section will demonstrate an example of how to migrate from PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.1 on Ubuntu 20.04.

First, we need to add PPA:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php -y
```

Then install PHP 8.1 and the required dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y php8.1-common \
php8.1-xml \
php8.1-cli \
php8.1-fpm \
php8.1-curl \
php8.1-mysqlnd \
php8.1-sqlite \
php8.1-soap \
php8.1-mbstring \
php8.1-zip \
php8.1-bcmath \
php8.1-dev \
php8.1-ldap \
php8.1-pgsql \
php8.1-interbase \
php8.1-gd \
php8.1-sybase
```

After successful installation we need to manually switch to PHP 8.1:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.1 \
sudo update-alternatives --set phar /usr/bin/phar8.1 \
sudo update-alternatives --set phar.phar /usr/bin/phar.phar8.1 \
```

Then select the version of PHP you need by using:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config php
```

{{< alert color="warning" title="Info" >}}
If you would like to know how to install the dependencies for the DreamFactory packages that you are interested in, you can refer to the table of contents below for guidance.

Command `pecl install` may fail with message like:

`pecl/sqlsrv is already installed and is the same as the released version 5.10.1 install failed`

In this case use force install: `pecl install -f <extension_name>`
{{< /alert >}}

### Configure NGINX
If you are using FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) with NGINX or Apache, you will need to update your DreamFactory installation's host configuration. To update the configuration for NGINX, you will need to modify the version of PHP specified in the Nginx server configuration file, which can be located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

```diff
-fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
+fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
```

Now we want to update our DreamFactory instance to the latest version. Use `git pull` command from the DreamFactory root directory. After that run the `composer install` command. Finally restart `fpm` and `nginx`:

```bash
sudo service php8.1-fpm restart && service nginx restart
```

### Cassandra
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

To use the Cassandra service, you need to recompile the driver and install the client library if you haven’t already.

[Download](https://github.com/datastax/cpp-driver/releases/tag/2.16.2) and extract the client library for Apache Cassandra. From the downloaded repository, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends libgmp-dev libpcre3-dev libssl-dev libuv1-dev cmake
```

```bash
mkdir build       &&\
pushd build       &&\
cmake ..          &&\
make              &&\
sudo make install &&\
popd
```

[Download](https://github.com/nano-interactive/ext-cassandra/tree/v1.3.x) the DataStax PHP Driver for Apache Cassandra. **Make sure that you are on the 1.3.x branch.** From the downloaded repository, run the following command:

```bash
# Currently, we are using a specific version of the repository that is still functional, 
# as the recent efforts to enhance the installation process do not work properly.
git checkout 1cf12c5ce49ed43a2c449bee4b7b23ce02a37bf0 &&\
pushd ext         &&\
phpize            &&\
popd              &&\
mkdir build       &&\
pushd build       &&\
../ext/configure  &&\
make              &&\
sudo make install &&\
popd
```

Make sure `cassandra.so` is built.

```
find /usr/lib/php/20210902/cassandra.so
```

If `cassandra.so` exists, connect it to PHP's modules.

```
echo 'extension=cassandra.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/cassandra.ini
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL cassandra
```

### Couchbase
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

With the new release of DreamFactory, we removed the Couchbase from the list of supported services. There is a possibility that support for Couchbase may be reinstated in future releases.

### Email
**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

The Mandrill & SparkPost mail drivers have been [removed from Laravel 6](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/upgrade). These services are technically not been supported by DreamFactory since its migration to Laravel 6. From now on, these services will no longer be displayed in the "Services" tab.

### Firebird
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

If you are using Firebird with major version 3, then it must be at least version 3.0.4. This is due to usage of the [LOCALTIMESTAMP parameter](https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/chunk/en/refdocs/fblangref40/fblangref40-contextvars-localtimestamp.html).

To use the Firebird service, you need to install/recompile a driver compatible with PHP 8.1. Use [`--with-pdo-firebird`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-firebird.php) to install the PDO Firebird extension or install `php81-interbase` package [from ppa:ondrej/php](#installing-the-php-extension).

### GitHub
**Likelihood Of Impact: Medium**

DreamFactory provided the ability to authenticate through the REST API using an account password or personal access token to perform authenticated API operations on GitHub.com. Beginning November 13th, 2020, GitHub announced that they will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating via the REST API and will require the use of token-based authentication. So if you have a registered DreamFactory GitHub service, ensure to specify a personal access token. For more information, please follow the [link](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/).

### Mongo logs
**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

DreamFactory supports a very simple solution for logging all requests. All records requested in the API will be written to the database. The implication is that DreamFactory relies on [MongoDB PHP driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/). You can easily install the required dependency with [pecl](https://pecl.php.net/package/mongodb). After that run this two commands:

```bash
echo 'extension=mongodb.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/mongodb.ini
sudo phpenmod -s ALL mongodb
```
### Apache Hive
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

In order to use the service, you will need to have both the [PDO](https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php) and [ODBC](https://www.php.net/manual/en/odbc.installation.php) PHP extensions installed, which are available for download from [this PPA](#installing-the-php-extension) with the names `php8.1-pdo` and `php8.1-odbc`, respectively. Additionally, the MapR ODBC Driver must be installed, which you can obtain by downloading from this [link](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/70/Hive/install-hive_odbc_connector_linux.html) or through the Amazon cloud, as we do. To install MapR ODBC Driver run:

```bash
cd /opt \
&& sudo curl --fail -O https://odbc-drivers.s3.amazonaws.com/apache-hive/maprhiveodbc_2.6.1.1001-2_amd64.deb \
&& sudo dpkg -i maprhiveodbc_2.6.1.1001-2_amd64.deb \
&& test -f /opt/mapr/hiveodbc/lib/64/libmaprhiveodbc64.so \
&& rm maprhiveodbc_2.6.1.1001-2_amd64.deb
```

Please note that it's crucial to install the extension using a specific path. So the full path to the driver must be - `/opt/mapr/hiveodbc/lib/64/libmaprhiveodbc64.so`

### Azure Active Directory
**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

Microsoft announced that Azure AD Graph will continue to function until June 30, 2023. Based on that we migrated towards Microsoft Graph. For more information, please follow the [link](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454).

### IBM Db2
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

DreamFactory services that work with IBM databases use software that can be loaded from [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/). This section is appointed for a self-hosted environment. To make DreamFactory work with the IBM Db2, you need to take the following steps:

Sign in to your [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) account or create a new one. Download the client driver package:

https://epwt-www.mybluemix.net/software/support/trial/cst/programwebsite.wss?siteId=853&h=null&p=null

Extract the downloaded file. From the “dsdriver” subdirectory, generate “*db2profile*” and “*db2cshrc*” script files:

```bash
sudo -s \
&& tar -xvf ibm_data_server_driver_package_linuxx64_v11.5.tar.gz -C /opt/ \
&& cd /opt/dsdriver \
&& apt install -y ksh \
&& ./installDSDriver
```

Sets the environment variables:

```
source db2profile (for the Bash or Korn shell)
source db2cshrc (for the C shell)
```

Clone the PDO_IBM [source code from GitHub](https://github.com/php/pecl-database-pdo_ibm). **Please note that this must be done from the same terminal since db2profile | db2cshrc sets the environment variables in the current terminal session.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/php/pecl-database-pdo_ibm /opt/PDO_IBM && \
cd /opt/PDO_IBM
```

From the cloned repository run:

```bash
export CPATH=/opt/dsdriver/include
```

```bash
phpize \
&& ./configure --with-pdo-ibm=/opt/dsdriver \
&& make \
&& make install \
&& exit
```

Check for the presence of `pdo_ibm.so`:

```bash
find "/usr/lib/php/20210902/pdo_ibm.so"
```

If `pdo_ibm.so` exists, connect it to PHP's modules.

```bash
echo 'extension=pdo_ibm.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/pdo_ibm.ini && \
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL pdo_ibm
```

### IBM Informix
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

DreamFactory services that work with IBM databases use software that can be loaded from [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/). This section is appointed for a self-hosted environment. To make DreamFactory work with the IBM Informix, you need to take the following steps:

Sign in to your [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) account or create a new one. Download the [Informix Client SDK](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/informix-client-software-development-kit-client-sdk-and-informix-connect-system-requirements).

<u>Download Informix Client SDK</u> ➜ <u>IBM Informix Client SDK downloads</u> ➜ *Fill out the form* ➜ *Select appropriate version* ➜ *Download tar file*

SDK may require to install `libncurses.so.5`.

```
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libncurses5 libncurses5:i386
```

Extract and install the SDK.

```
sudo -s
tar -xvf your_archive
./installclientsdk
```

Now we have two options to install `pdo_informix.so`: using `pecl` or building it manually. We prefer the second method since we didn't succeed with `pecl`.

Download the [PDO_INFORMIX](https://pecl.php.net/package/pdo_informix) archive and extract it. From extracted _PDO_INFORMIX-1.3.x_ folder run:

```bash
phpize \
&& ./configure --with-pdo-informix=/opt/IBM/Informix_Client-SDK \
&& make \
&& make install \
&& exit
```

If you decide to test your luck, and install [PDO_INFORMIX](https://pecl.php.net/package/pdo_informix) using `pecl`:

```bash
sudo pecl install PDO_INFORMIX
```

Set the environment variables in `.profile`. Open the file for editing with:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.profile
```

Add the following lines to the bottom of the file.

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/IBM/Informix_Client-SDK/lib:/opt/IBM/Informix_Client-SDK/lib/esql" 
export INFORMIXDIR="/opt/IBM/Informix_Client-SDK"
```

Make sure `pdo_informix.so` is built.

```bash
find /usr/lib/php/20210902/pdo_informix.so
```

If `pdo_informix.so` exists, connect it to PHP's modules.

```bash
echo 'extension=pdo_informix.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/pdo_informix.ini && \
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL pdo_informix
```

### LDAP & Active Directory
**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

DreamFactory uses [Lightweight Directory Access Protocol](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ldap.php) to lookup information or devices within a network. Therefore, to continue working with these services, you need to install the LDAP [extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ldap.installation.php) for the new version of PHP. For a quick setup, see the ['Installing the PHP extension'](#installing-the-php-extension) section.

### MQTT
**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

Previously, the MQTT service relied on the [Mosquitto-PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) extension, which in turn relies upon the [libmosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) library. From now on, this service no longer depends on the system's needs and contains everything you need to work in itself.

### Oracle
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

{{< alert color="success" title="Tip" >}}
This section shows the minimum number of steps to set up required dependencies so that DreamFactory can work with Oracle. For a complete setup, follow the [official guide](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/releasenote-odbc-ic.html).
{{< /alert >}}

To use the Oracle service, you need to install the new version of the `oci8` extension compatible with PHP 8.1. You can seamlessly install the required extension version you need via [pecl](https://pecl.php.net/package/oci8). But before installation, you need to go through a few more steps:

Download the desired Instant Client and the corresponding SDK Package. We will show the example of RPM packages.

https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html

Install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install -y alien libaio1
```

Install the Oracle client packages. This may take a few minutes.

```
sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient-basic-21.9.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient-devel-21.9.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

Now we are good to install the `oci8` extension. The latest version is compatible with PHP 8.1 at present, but you may need to specify the version explicitly.

```
sudo pecl install oci8 (php 8.1 exactly what we need)
sudo pecl install oci8-2.2.0 (php 7)
```

Once complete, make sure that OCI is loaded:

```bash
php -m | grep oci8

#oci8
```

If you do not see `oci8` in PHP's modules, ensure that the configuration file and the OCI shared library file are plugged in.

Check for the presence of `osi8.so`:

```bash
find "/usr/lib/php/20210902/oci8.so"
```

If `osi8.so` exists, connect it to PHP's modules.

```bash
echo 'extension=oci8.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/oci8.ini && \
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL oci8
```

### SAP SQL Anywhere
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

{{< alert color="success" title="Tip" >}}
We have an [article](http://localhost:1313/docs/installing-and-configuring-dreamfactory/#installing-the-pdo-and-pdo_dblib-extensions) on installing the necessary dependencies for SQL Anywhere on CentOS.
{{< /alert >}}

All you need is to install the Sybase module from PPA. [See how to add PPA to your Apt repositories](#installing-the-php-extension). This package provides `php8.1-pdo-dblib`, which is what we need.

```bash
sudo apt install php8.1-sybase
```

Once complete, make sure that the driver is installed successfully. Confirm both PDO and the pdo_dblib extensions are present:

```bash
php -m
...
#PDO
#pdo_dblib
...
```

### Snowflake
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

To use the Snowflake service, you need to recompile the `pdo_snowflake` driver using the new PHP version. After completion, make sure the module is installed into the proper extensions directory. See official guide: https://github.com/snowflakedb/pdo_snowflake

### Microsoft SQL Server
**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

> To use a Microsoft SQL Server database, you should ensure that you have the sqlsrv and pdo_sqlsrv PHP extensions installed as well as any dependencies they may require such as the Microsoft SQL ODBC driver.

Install ODBC libraries for UNIX from the [Microsoft repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/linux-package-repository-for-microsoft-software).

```bash
sudo apt install -y unixodbc-dev
```

If you are encountering issues with the `unixodbc-dev` package, it may be due to a recent release. As a workaround, you can lock the package version to a stable one (e.g. v2.3.7) until a fix is released. For more details, refer to the relevant [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/linux-package-repositories/issues/36).

Install [sqlsrv](https://pecl.php.net/package/sqlsrv) and [pdo_sqlsrv](https://pecl.php.net/package/pdo_sqlsrv) from pecl.

```
sudo pecl install sqlsrv
sudo pecl install pdo_sqlsrv
```

Check for the presence of `sqlsrv` and `pdo_sqlsrv`:

```
find "/usr/lib/php/20210902/sqlsrv.so"
find "/usr/lib/php/20210902/pdo_sqlsrv.so"
```

If we get both SO files, connect it to PHP's modules.

```
echo 'extension=sqlsrv.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/sqlsrv.ini
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL sqlsrv

echo 'extension=pdo_sqlsrv.so' | sudo tee /etc/php/8.1/mods-available/pdo_sqlsrv.ini
sudo phpenmod -v 8.1 -s ALL pdo_sqlsrv
```

Finally, install the Microsoft ODBC driver for SQL Server following the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16#ubuntu18), or using the [Microsoft repository](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=msodbcsql).

### Installing the PHP extension

Installation of the necessary dependencies can be quite an agonizing process, so concerned people make this process as painless as possible. [Ondřej Surý](https://deb.sury.org/) maintains the repository with PHP packages and is a very well-respected contributor to the PHP community. See how you can install the required PHP dependencies in three easy steps.

First add [`ppa:ondrej/php`](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php) to our APT repositories.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
```

Update list of available packages.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Install the required dependency. In this example, we will demonstrate the installation of [LDAP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ldap.php) extension.

```bash
sudo apt install php8.1-ldap
```
